However, there are still wide bezels around the screen, but this is acceptable within this price range. The back has been redesigned to feature a large circular camera module, resulting in a much more sophisticated look compared to its playful predecessor. Its color selection, consisting of dark green, black or medium blue, is also more mature. The shiny case is quite susceptible to collecting fingerprint marks. Xiaomi's Redmi A3 can be twisted  slightly at the sides, and applying medium pressure onto its display already results in the screen's liquid crystal becoming visible. The phone's build is flawless. One big advantage the Redmi A3 has over its predecessor is its USB-C port which makes the phone much more compatible when it comes to chargers and cables. The modern budget phone from Xiaomi doesn't support NFC. It continues to feature a dedicated microSD card slot, so you can insert a memory card alongside two SIM cards. During our tests using the Angelbird V60 as a reference microSD card, the card reader proved to be speedy for its price class, but at no point was it able to make use of the fast microSD card's full potential.",

Running the show under the hood is an Helio G35 chipset. Let’s talk about the OneUI core experience first. It is built on top of Android 12. The lighter version of Samsung’s proprietary OS looks good. You get all those regular Samsung features with fewer customizations. Thankfully, Samsung hasn’t installed bloatware here but you do get a bunch of Microsoft and Google apps preinstalled. Most of them can be uninstalled. In performance The phone boasts an entry-level Mediatek Helio P35 chip from 2018. The P35 gets the job done for those wanting the basic experience. It can handle day-to-day activities like using social media, multitasking, light gaming, etc.  But the catch is that its performance is just average. In case you are willing to play some games on this guy, I’ll advise you to stick to basic games like Subway Surfers, Candy Crush, Temple Run, and such. I tried playing PUBG and the max it can go is–balanced graphics at a Medium frame rate. To no surprise, graphics rendering takes a significantly longer time on PUBG. The game is barely playable and not so enjoyable on this phone. Apart from that, A04 is good to go for light gaming. Design: the phone is made up of plastic as expected. The front side houses a waterdrop notch which I think is the norm for budget phones these days. The device weighs 192 grams which is a bit heavier if you are coming from a lightweight phone. Nevertheless, it doesn’t feel bulky though. I like the camera module on the rear side, arising from the surface. But, the headphone jack placement is at the bottom left side which feels a bit awkward while gaming in portrait mode.",
